# Cloud Foundry and Tanzu application Service

## Project purpose

The goal of this project is to have a good understanding of Cloud Foundry. We will use a solution certified by the cloud foundry foundation, VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) [v2.11](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/2.11/tas-for-vms/runtime-rn.html). The cloud provider used will be GCP.

Once the Google Cloud credits have been validated, upgrade the account to benefit from all the features and not be limited in the number of IP addresses, for example.

:warning: When the credits are exhausted, the invoicing will be taken from the credit card registered during the creation of the account

## Prerequisites
  
- Linux computer
- Gmail account to benefit from Google Cloud credits
- [Broadcom support portal](https://profile.broadcom.com/web/registration) with the same email address to download the different products related to Tanzu
- domain name of a registrar. Following the workshop, the domain name was purchased from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca). If your registrar is not GoDaddy, similar steps should be performed.
