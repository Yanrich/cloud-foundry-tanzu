# Cloud Foundry and Tanzu application Service

## Project purpose

The goal of this project is to have a good understanding of Cloud Foundry. We will use a solution certified by the cloud foundry foundation, VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) [v2.11](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/2.11/tas-for-vms/runtime-rn.html). The cloud provider used will be GCP.

## Prerequisites
  
- Linux computer
- Gmail account to benefit from Google Cloud credits
- [VMware Account](https://account.run.pivotal.io/z/uaa/sign-up) with the same email address to download the different products on network.pivotal.io
- domain name of a registrar. Following the workshop, the domain name was purchased from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca). If your registrar is not GoDaddy, similar steps should be performed.
